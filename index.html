                    Mozart often spent much time at the clavier, picking out thirds, which he was ever striking, 
                    and his pleasure showed that it sounded good.... In the fourth year of his age his father, 
                    for a game as it were, began to teach him a few minuets and pieces at the clavier.... He could 
                    play it faultlessly and with the greatest delicacy, and keeping exactly in time.... At the age of 
                    five, he was already composing little pieces, which he played to his father who wrote them down.

                <p>Mozart was born in Salzburg (Austria).</p> 
                <p>He showed prodigious ability from his earliest childhood. Already competent on piano and violin, he 
                    composed from the age of five and performed before European royalty.</p>
                <p>At 17, Mozart was appointed as a musician at the Salzburg court, but he grew restless and traveled 
                    in search of a better position.</p>
                <p>While visiting Vienna in 1781, he was dismissed from his Salzburg position. He chose to stay in the 
                    capital, where he achieved fame but little financial security.</p>
                <p>During his final years in Vienna, he composed many of his best-known symphonies, concertos, and 
                    operas, and portions of the Requiem, which was largely unfinished at the time of his death.</p>
                <p>The circumstances of his early death have been the object of many discussions and arguments.</p>
                <p>He composed more than 600 works, many acknowledged as pinnacles of symphonic, concert ante, chamber, 
                operatic, and choral music. He is among the most enduringly popular of classical composers, and his 
                influence is profound on subsequent Western art music. Ludwig van Beethoven composed his own early 
                works in the shadow of Mozart, and Joseph Haydn wrote that "posterity will not see such a talent again 
                in 100 years".</p>
